# ============================================
# Development Environment Backend Configuration
# ============================================
# AWS S3 backend for Terraform state management
# Enables state locking via DynamoDB, versioning, and team collaboration
#
# IMPORTANT: Before using this backend, run the setup script:
#   ./setup-backend.sh --env dev
#
# Usage: terraform init -backend-config=environments/dev.tfbackend

# S3 Bucket Configuration
# The bucket name includes your AWS account ID for uniqueness
# Update this after running setup-backend.sh
bucket         = "unified-health-tfstate-dev-ACCOUNT_ID"
key            = "env/dev/terraform.tfstate"
region         = "us-east-1"

# Encryption - Always enabled for security
encrypt        = true

# DynamoDB table for state locking
# Prevents concurrent modifications to the state
dynamodb_table = "unified-health-terraform-locks-dev"

# Optional: Use KMS key for additional encryption (recommended for sensitive environments)
# kms_key_id   = "alias/unified-health-terraform-dev"

# Optional: Enable assume role for cross-account access
# role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/TerraformStateAccess"

# Optional: External ID for assume role (if required by the role trust policy)
# external_id  = "unified-health-terraform"

# Optional: Session name for assume role
# session_name = "TerraformDev"
